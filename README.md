# TanTan Userbot

This is a user bot that can perform various tasks. It includes a command to send draft messages to users and a command to run a mailing with drafts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `config.py` file and configure the necessary variables. Make sure to include the API credentials for the bot.

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules and create a Pyrogram client instance.
   ```python
   from pyrogram import Client

   app = Client("user_bot")
   ```

2. Create a `config.py` file with the required configurations. Include the API credentials for the bot.

3. Define the handlers for the commands in your script. For example:

   ```python
   from pyrogram.types import Message
   from pyrogram import filters

   text = 'üìÑhelp\n\n__prefixes: (!, ., /)tan__ - **üïä—Ä–∞—Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞ —á–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏–∫–∞–º–∏**'

   @app.on_message(filters.command(['help'], prefixes=['/', '!', '.']) & filters.all)
   async def help(_, message):
       """
       Handler for the message help
       """
       try:
           mess = await message.edit(text)
       except:
           mess = await message.reply(text)
   ```

   ```python
   @app.on_message(filters.command(['tan'], prefixes=['/', '!', '.']) & filters.all)
   async def run(_, message: Message):
       """
       Handler for the message run mailing (with Draft)
       """
       await run_tantan(message)
   ```

4. Implement the `run_tantan` function in your script. This function runs the mailing with draft messages, which is a safer approach for sending bulk messages.

   ```python
   import asyncio
   import random
   import time

   import pyrogram
   from pyrogram.types import Message

   async def run_tantan(message: Message):
       """
       Runs the mailing with draft messages.

       Args:
           message (Message): The message object that triggered the function.

       Returns:
           None
       """

       # Your code for running the mailing goes here

   ```

5. Run your script and start using the user bot commands.

Note: Make sure to create the necessary files and directories mentioned in the code (`data/usernames.csv` and `data/usernames.txt`) and adjust the file paths accordingly.

Remember to handle errors and exceptions appropriately based on your specific use case.
